file Provisoners?
The file provisioner is used to copy files or directories from the machine executing Terraform to the newly created resource. The file provisioner supports both ssh and winrm type connections.

remote-exec Provisoners?
The remote-exec provisioner invokes a script on a remote resource after it is created. This can be used to run a configuration management tool, bootstrap into a cluster, etc.  The remote-exec provisioner supports both ssh and winrm type connections.

local-exec Provisoners?
The local-exec provisioner invokes a local executable after a resource is created. This invokes a process on the machine running Terraform, not on the resource.
